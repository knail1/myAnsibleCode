# this file documents an install of cloud foundry (MINIMAL version) on AWS. I didn't want to follow the normal install (which is 20+ VMs)

*Original instructions of this install are at:*
*https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release/tree/master/example_manifests*

*My goal is to automate this complete install at some point. this file will be updated via version control as I automate various sections...*

## The steps are:

1. create a dir ~/my-bosh
2. create manifest: bosh.yml

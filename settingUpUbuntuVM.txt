settingUpUbuntuVM.txt

install via 
- downloading ubuntu-16.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso
- creating a VB ubuntu image (i gave 4GB RAM, and 40GB dynamic disk)
	- creating a 2nd HOST ONLY INTERFACE
	- on the local VB network settings, this vboxnet* interface was set to 192.168.56.1
	- enabled DHCP server, 192.168.56.100(server), /24 mask, range: 56.101-252
- attaching the iso to the image, and booting, initial manual installing
- at this point from the ubuntu server:
	- i can now ping the internet (from first eth interface)
	- i received 192.168.56.101 on eth2

- from the mac (host):
	- i can ping 192.168.56.101 through my vbnoxnet* interface (with IP 56.1)
	- i cannot ssh into the ubuntu server

- so let's enable ssh on the ubuntu VM:

http://askubuntu.com/questions/51925/how-do-i-configure-a-new-ubuntu-installation-to-accept-ssh-connections

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
sudo ufw allow 22


- at this point, I can ssh into the ubuntu server from my mac but still using u/p

- let's enable passwordless ssh on ubuntu:
http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2008/11/3-steps-to-perform-ssh-login-without-password-using-ssh-keygen-ssh-copy-id/

	- i already have local ssh public/private keys generated so skipping first few steps from URL
	- i copy my mac's .ssh/id_rsa.pub over to the ubuntu box (via sftp)
	- i rename (mv) this id_rsa.pub on the ubuntu to : ~knail1/.ssh/authorized_keys

I can now log into ubuntu VM from my mac via ssh knail1@192.168.56.101 (without password)

- everything else can be configured via ansible.
[ansible]$ cat /etc/ansible/hosts
[ubuntu]
gubuntu1
[ansible]$
[ansible]$ grep gubuntu1 /etc/hosts
192.168.56.101	gubuntu1
[ansible]$
[ansible]$ ansible ubuntu -m ping -u knail1

gubuntu1 | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
[ansible]$

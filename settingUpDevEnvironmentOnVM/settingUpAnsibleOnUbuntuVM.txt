settingUpAnsibleOnUbuntu.txt


El-capitan is a real pain in the ass. It doesn't allow me to write into certain "priveleged" paths within the machine. this poses a real problem, since I cannot install new setup-tools , and pretty much 50% of any "sudo pip install ..." commands fail.

I needed to install ansible-container on my mac but it failed b/c of the same reasons... so i'm going to move all my ansible container dev over to the mac and run the ansible code locally on that box.

to do this, need to do a few things first:

- using virtualbox file sharing settings , I shared the local ~/coding/myAnsibleCode over to the VM (selected auto-mount)
- installed guest VM additions on the ubuntu VM (setup>..)
- mounted the MAC (myAnsibleCode) over, but ensured the user/group/umask rights were clean so I could code as knail1 (uid:1000,gid:1000) on the ubuntu box and not have to flip to root all the time

`sudo mount -t vboxsf -o umask=0022,gid=1000,uid=1000 myAnsibleCode mnt/myAnsibleCode/`

- created an ssh key on the ubuntu box (ssh-keygen), and put my id_rsa.pub (public key) into github so I can do git push's without password.

- also:
gubuntu1 [myAnsibleCode]$ git config --global user.email "oansari@gmail.com"
gubuntu1 [myAnsibleCode]$ git config --global user.name "Omer Ansari"
gubuntu1 [myAnsibleCode]$ git config --global core.editor "vi"

settingUpAnsibleOnUbuntu.txt


El-capitan is a real pain in the ass. It doesn't allow me to write into certain "priveleged" paths within the machine. this poses a real problem, since I cannot install new setup-tools , and pretty much 50% of any "sudo pip install ..." commands fail.

I needed to install ansible-container on my mac but it failed b/c of the same reasons... so i'm going to move all my ansible container dev over to the mac and run the ansible code locally on that box.

to do this, need to do a few things first:

- using virtualbox file sharing settings , I shared the local ~/coding/myAnsibleCode over to the VM (selected auto-mount)
- installed guest VM additions on the ubuntu VM (setup>..)
- mounted the MAC (myAnsibleCode) over, but ensured the user/group/umask rights were clean so I could code as knail1 (uid:1000,gid:1000) on the ubuntu box and not have to flip to root all the time

`sudo mount -t vboxsf -o umask=0022,gid=1000,uid=1000 myAnsibleCode mnt/myAnsibleCode/`

- created an ssh key on the ubuntu box (ssh-keygen), and put my id_rsa.pub (public key) into github so I can do git push's without password.

- also:
gubuntu1 [myAnsibleCode]$ git config --global user.email "oansari@gmail.com"
gubuntu1 [myAnsibleCode]$ git config --global user.name "Omer Ansari"
gubuntu1 [myAnsibleCode]$ git config --global core.editor "vi"
g

- set up in github access token for my gubuntu box.
	* https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/
	* (that let me git push however required me to put it each time ...) 

`
gubuntu1 [.git]$ more config
[core]
	repositoryformatversion = 0
	filemode = true
	bare = false
	logallrefupdates = true
	ignorecase = true
	precomposeunicode = true
[remote "origin"]
	url = https://github.com/knail1/myAnsibleCode.git   <------change to git
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
[branch "master"]
	remote = origin
	merge = refs/heads/master
`

- to remove that restriction, I also changed the config url from https to git so that I dont have to always put access token
	* http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8588768/git-push-username-password-how-to-avoid
	* its still asking for my passphrase but thats less painful..

- on the VM itself:

run :
`ubuntu1 [settingUpDevEnvironmentOnVM]$ ansible-playbook -vvvv -u knail1 --ask-sudo-pass -e "username=knail1" installAnsibleStuff.yml`



/* I didnt run the above, just ran the manual commands below, but the ansible stuff should work 
`gubuntu1 [settingUpDocker]$ sudo apt-get install ansible`

then

`sudo pip install ansible-container`

clean and painless install, much easier than mac!!
